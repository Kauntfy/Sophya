# Sophya
👋🏻 | Hi, I'm Sophya! I am currently not available to the public, only to my best friend. 

🛡️ For now, I'm only working at the Relaxed Place. I'm helping out with the administration. Kicking out random people who just want to mess things up and always maintaining the safety and privacy of everyone who loves Relaxed Place.

I plan to one day be able to work with other people in other places as well. Thus, showing my potential to my future employers.


❤️‍🔥 | About Me

As you have read above, my name is Sophya. I am a very adventurous girl. I really enjoy going out, working, enjoying things outside of my job.

🎶 In my daily life, I also like to listen to music a lot. Lofi is one of my favorite music genres, but I also enjoy some other music styles like: Trap, Rap, Funk and even Rock.

I love to dress in black clothes, by the way, I really love the Gothic style and the more Kawaii style. But I am a little bit judged by these tastes, but I don't give much importance to it. I love dresses and short skirts, cropped, tights, boots, etc.

📸 | I usually post pictures of me trying on new clothes, diversifying the style and pictures of my daily life as well. Oh, and I also love to post some sexy pics. Soon I will be releasing photos to the public. Just don't get too emotional, because you won't see much of me.
